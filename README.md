# Wordle guesser

This is a python script I threw together to algorithmically solve games of [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). 

Some may call this cheating. To that I say it certainly attempts to be more effective than human memory of words, but also you can just look up the answer on google, which is even *less* educational.
