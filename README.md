# Wordle guesser

This is a python script I threw together to algorithmically solve games of [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). 

Some may call this cheating. To that I say it certainly attempts to be more effective than human memory of words, but also you can just look up the answer on google, which is even *less* educational. 


Coincidentally, the literal day after I wrote this, 3blue1brown posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) that goes into way more math and essentially does the same thing as this script, but obviously way better since I hacked this together in a few hours.
